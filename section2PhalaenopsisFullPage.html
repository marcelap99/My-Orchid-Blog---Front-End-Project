      <h2 id='phalaenopsisSubHeading'>6 REASONS WHY THE MOTH ORCHID IS EVERYONE’S FAVORITE ORCHID</h2>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" >Because orchids have a reputation for being hard to grow, everyone always wants to know what the easiest orchid for beginners is, and the answer is nearly always the same: phalaenopsis orchids.

      These plants, also known as “moth orchids” for the delicate wing-like shape of their leaves, are popular with beginners (and veterans, too!) because of the relative ease with which they can be grown.

      No matter your skill level, here are six reasons why you should have a phalaenopsis orchid orchid in your collection:</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >One Stem = Focused Care</span> – While some orchids have multiple stems, each of which can contain several flower spikes, the phalaenopsis orchid is monopodial. Which simply means that it always has just one main stem.
      While beginners might want to go for the orchid with the “most” flowers, the one stem on a moth orchid is easier to care for. This means it can still grow several colorful flowers, while giving it a delicate yet robust appearance. And that, for many, is what the orchid is all about in the first place, right?</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >Manageable Sunlight</span> – While some orchids can have touchy light requirements such as direct sunlight or even exposure to moonlight, the phalaenopsis orchid is pretty “middle of the road” as far as this goes.
      Abundant but indirect sunlight is key, so mostly any location that has at least a little shade for part of the day is great. (These plants also do well indoors for this very reason.)</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >Manageable Temperature Needs</span> – The relaxed attitude the moth orchid has towards light also extends to its temperature needs. While some orchids can’t handle even slight variations in cold or heat, the phalaenopsis orchid does well in temps ranging from 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (so room temperature is fine). It won’t be in much danger unless temperatures go outside the 60-90 degrees F range.</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >Standard Humidity Needs</span> – Some orchids thrive in tropical climates, and others grow best in drier areas. Again, the phalaenopsis orchid is fantastic because it is tolerant of greater variations in humidity than most other orchids. As long as humidity is around 50%, you’ll be fine. No matter where you live, this can easily be achieved with a basic humidifier.</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >Water and Walk Away</span> – Unlike some orchids that demand constant attention to the level of hydration, phalaenopsis orchids are more forgiving. This isn’t to say that proper watering isn’t important; the moth orchid needs a careful balance of water as much as any other plant.
      The key is that this particular genera does well with minimal care – you can generally water them about once a week and they’ll be fine.</p>

      <p class="phalaenopsisP" > <span class="emphasizedText" >Constant Blooming</span> – The moth orchid contains no pseudobulbs, which means that once the plant enters the blooming stage, all its energy is pretty much directed towards the flowers.
      With the proper care, you can keep this orchid in a state of constant blooming for a long, nearly indefinite period of time. Since re-blooming is one of the more difficult aspects of growing orchids, this is a great reason to give phalaenopsis orchids a try.
      From their resistance to beginner mistakes to their colorful and fragrant blooms, phalaenopsis orchids are a favorite that you’re certain to love.</p>
